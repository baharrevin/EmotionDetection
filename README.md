# EmotionDetection

Emotion Detection is a real-time emotion detection system powered by Python. It uses computer vision techniques to analyze facial expressions and determine the user's current emotional state. Based on the detected emotion, the system dynamically responds â€” for example, by playing matching music or displaying emotion-based messages.

### Technologies Used:
* Python
* OpenCV for facial expression recognition
* Deep Learning / Emotion classification model
* pygame for audio playback (emotion-based music)

### Key Features:
* Detects emotions from facial expressions in real-time
* Matches detected emotions with custom audio and messages
